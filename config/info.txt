The config folder in this repository serves as a centralized location for configuration files and related information crucial for setting up 
and maintaining the PantryPulse website. This folder helps streamline the setup process, making it easier for others to deploy and configure 
the website. Hereâ€™s an overview of what you can include in the config folder:

1. wp-config-sample.php:
This is a template for the WordPress configuration file (wp-config.php). It contains placeholder values that users need to replace with their 
actual database credentials and other configuration details. Including a sample configuration file helps new users understand how to configure 
WordPress for your site.

2. .htaccess:
This file provides a sample of the .htaccess configuration that is typically used for URL rewriting, security rules, and performance optimizations. 
Users can rename this file to .htaccess and modify it as needed.

By organizing these configuration files and documentation in the config folder, you provide a clear and structured way for others to set up and manage 
the PantryPulse website, making the deployment process much smoother and more efficient.
